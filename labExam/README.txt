------------------------------------------------------------

EXECUTION:

g++ sol.cpp
./a.out

------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The input has already been coded into the program.

The ENTRY node is numbered 7, the EXIT is numbered 8.

The program outputs just the required outputs of 
Tasks 1 and 2. However, to get the processing information
for the various iterations of the liveness analysis part, 
define DEBUG on line 13.

Again compile and run to get the complete info on all 
the iterations of the process.
